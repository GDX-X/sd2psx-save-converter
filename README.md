# sd2psx-save-converter

This script will be useful if you have a lot of saved data in .PSU format and use the Game ID option with your sd2psx. It allows you to convert all your .PSU to mcd or mc2 individually with their own game id

# FOR .PSU

Drop your .PSU files into the PSU folder

# FOR .MCD or .MC2

Drop the entire folder of yours Memory Cards

example: Card1\Card1-1.mcd into MCD or MC2 folder

will be exported to the "MC_Exported" folder with the channels so as not to overwrite the savedata of the same name if they are in several channels.

NOTE: BootCard.mcd and BEDATA-SYSTEM.PSU will be ignored
